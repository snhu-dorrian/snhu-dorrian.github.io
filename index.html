				<h2>Self Assessment</h2>
				<div class="Reflection">
					<p>
						During my time in the CS program I've gained the technical and professional skills to pursue my career goals. Updating these 
						artifacts has improved my ability to think about building scalable systems with security, performance, and maintenance in mind. 
						This isn't limited to only technical skills however. Collaborating with others is an essential skill no matter where you go. The ability 
						to build features as a team, communicate with key figures, refine requirements, and collaborate with outside teams are all necessary skills. 
					</p>
					<p>
						These artifacts are a reflection of the full range of skills I've learned and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. 
						The three featured artifacts-a BST enhancement to use a Red Black Tree, a software design document revision, and a WinForms desktop version 
						of a single-page app-were selected to showcase my capabilities in generic low-level implementations, system documentation and 
						planning, and cross-platform application development. Together, they reflect my ability to design, implement, and explain systems. These artifacts 
						are not just representations of coursework, they're milestones in my journey toward becoming a computer scientist. They demonstrate 
						my ability to adapt and use industry standard techniques in any professional software development or systems engineering role.
