		<h1><a href="https://github.com/snhu-dorrian/RBTree">Binary Search Tree Enhancement - DSA Artifact</a></h1>
		<p>
			This artifact is a conversion of the binary search tree in C++ to a red-black-tree in C#. Itâ€™s a self-balancing BST that was created in 1972, 
			10 years after the initial creation of the AVL tree, another type of self-balancing tree. I used this artifact since it requires two large 
			enhancements on top of a language overhaul.
		</p>
		<h2>Generics</h2>
		<p>
			The first enhancements over the initial C++ implementation is a generic implementation using the 
			IObservable interface. This requires all values to implement the .CompareTo() method for tree traversal 
			but allows a more library or language level implementation of the data structure.

		<h2>Tree Balancing</h2>
		<p>
			The second enhancement had the largest challenges due to the auto-balancing implementation. The rotations were slightly confusing and it took videos and 
			<a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html">visualization tools</a> to understand transplants for deletions. 
			I ended up changing some minor details, for example I ended up ditching the ref type for simplicity, although in retrospect it seems to operate 
			like a pointer. I also swapped the color enum to a bool since there are only two possible values, red or not red.

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>
			The enhancements for this project were my favorite. It was my first dive into C# and one of the few times
			I've worked with generics and interfaces on a meaningful scale. It provided a realistic implementation of
			what these structures would look like in a library by following strict requirements.
			Additionally, I learned some places generics could be used in large applications. Generic database
			operations with model binding and custom interfaces, particularly when it comes to creating factories and
			other design patterns.
