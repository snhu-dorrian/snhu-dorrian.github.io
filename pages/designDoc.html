		<h1>System Design Enhancement</h1>

		<p>
			The system design enhancement is an and update to the original requirements of the DriverPass system made in CS255. 
			Originally the document only contained technical requirements and the four UML diagrams Use Case, Activity, Class, and Sequence diagrams. 
			With this enhancement design constraints, API endpoints, and a component diagram were added to be more in line with my current knowledge. 
			In addition the class diagram was also updated to reflect large changes to structure and the addition of the authentication and payment services.
		</p>

		<h2>Enhancements</h2>
		<p>
			Starting with the design constraints the requirements for the application and how it would run were added. 
			This means in addition to some overlapping technical requirements, the mobile compatibility, dmv compliance, 
			and offline access constraints were added as well. The API endpoint addition includes user management, authentication, 
			payment processing, reservation management, and report generation. Additionally, the component diagram reflects the 
			client machine having two main interfaces, a database with redundancy, application services, and the two external services 
			for authentication and payment processing.
