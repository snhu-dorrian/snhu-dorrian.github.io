			<h1>Animal Shelter Enhancement</h1>
            <p>
                The Animal Shelter application was selected for the database category and was originally a web app with focused around Python and MongoDB. In this enhancement
                the goal goal was to rework the application from the ground up. Switching from web based to a desktop application unsing winforms and SQL Server. The goal was to become familiar
                with a new DBMS, in this case Entity Framework Core, as well as keep some of the original functionality. In order to do this I created a table schema similar to the MongoDB document schema
                and added a dashboard with a table. Continue reflection here
